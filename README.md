How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?

One effective method for capturing these requirements is through user stories, which break down user needs into clear, actionable statements.
Acceptance criteria are another that defines the conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete. This establishes clear expectations 
and guiding the development process.

To ensure the software continues to meet user goals, it is essential to have a proxy group regularly review the application. 
Their feedback helps validate whether the implemented features align with both the stated and evolving needs of the users. 

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?.

When approaching program development, I prefer an iterative process. I have found that stakeholders often need something tangible. 
Such as prototypes or mock-ups, they can provide meaningful feedback. These early visuals or models allow users to interact with the
concept, share opinions, and guide adjustments. Changes in direction after seeing these early versions are not setbacks, but rather valuable
insights that can help refine the final product. 

In terms of methodology, I plan to continue using agile principles in my future projects, emphasizing adaptability, collaboration, and incremental improvement. 
Agile's iterative cycles align perfectly with how people make decisions. These are through iterations, feedback, and gradual refinement.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means being honest, communicative, and willing to learn. Every project involves a mix of tasks. When I encounter 
challenges or unfamiliar technologies, I believe in being transparent and seeking help from fellow teammates. Often, theres an existing design pattern or library 
that can provide the right solution, and collaboration helps uncover it more efficiently.
